### Boston_House_Pricing

This project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in various suburbs of Boston using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for house prices in Boston, leveraging the features in the dataset to understand the factors influencing house prices.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Boston House Pricing dataset. It contains 13 features and 1 target variable:

* Features
CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.

DIS: Weighted distance to employment centres.

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.

TAX: Property tax rate (per $10,000).

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.

B: Proportion of African American residents by town.

LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population.

Target Variable
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1,000s.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performing EDA to understand relationships between different variables and the target variable. Some common visualizations include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

* Modeling
Build and evaluate various machine learning models:

Linear Regression

* Results
Summarize the performance of different models and highlight the best-performing model with visualizations and key metrics.
